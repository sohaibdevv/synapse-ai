# Synapse - AI Conversational Chat

Synapse is a modern, responsive, and intuitive web-based chat application designed to showcase the power and capabilities of the Google Gemini API. It serves as a demonstration of how to integrate a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) into a user-friendly frontend interface, providing a seamless conversational experience.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to test and demonstrate the advanced features of the Google Gemini API, specifically the `gemini-2.5-flash` model. It aims to highlight:

-   **Real-time Interaction:** Streaming responses from the AI to create a fluid and dynamic conversation.
-   **Rich Content Formatting:** The AI's ability to generate and display formatted content like code blocks, lists, and other markdown elements.
-   **Ease of Integration:** How the `@google/genai` SDK can be cleanly integrated into a modern React application.
-   **Quality of AI:** The quality, speed, and helpfulness of the responses generated by the Gemini model.

## Features

-   **Real-time Streaming:** Messages from the AI are streamed token-by-token, providing immediate feedback.
-   **Markdown Support:** Renders bold text, italics, code blocks, and more for clear and structured responses.
-   **Responsive Design:** A clean and modern UI that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
-   **Error Handling:** Provides clear feedback to the user in case of API errors.
-   **Easy to Use:** A simple, single-page interface focused on the conversation.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, lightweight tech stack, avoiding complex build configurations.

-   **Frontend Library:** **React** with TypeScript for a robust and type-safe component-based architecture.
-   **AI Integration:** **Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)** using the `gemini-2.5-flash` model for fast and high-quality chat completions.
-   **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first approach to building a custom and responsive design.
-   **Module System:** Native **ES Modules** with `importmap` for dependency management directly in the browser, using `esm.sh` as a CDN. This demonstrates a modern, buildless development approach.

## Getting Started

To run this application, you need a valid Google Gemini API key.

1.  **API Key:** The application is designed to securely access the API key from a `process.env.API_KEY` environment variable, which must be configured in the execution environment.
2.  **Serve the Files:** Open the `index.html` file in a compatible web browser or serve it using a local static file server.

The application will initialize the chat session and be ready for interaction.
